
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning. It leverages the Logistic Regression algorithm with preprocessing and evaluation metrics to determine how well the model can classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.


## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split for model evaluation
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification
- Model performance evaluation with:
    - Accuracy Score

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the Titanic dataset, which contains passenger details such as age, class, sex, and survival status.

You can download it from Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
